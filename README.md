# Olena Hlotova . Jarvis Consulting

I am a forward-thinking Junior Data Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. In the past few years, I have proven myself focused and diligent in managing workloads and prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines. Working at Jarvis, I participated in multiple technical projects like Linux Monitoring Agent, Java Grepp and Twitter apps. Creating useful apps I and my friends can use makes me extremely happy. As an example, I wrote a Telegram bot that helps the user keep track of their fitness exercises daily. I am ready to make a direct impact, utilizing abilities in quality control and complex problem-solving to find the best solutions and achieve desirable results.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OlenaHlotova](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OlenaHlotova)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OlenaHlotova/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that can be used to record and monitor nodes/server hardware specifications and memory usage. Implemented the project on Linux CentOS 7 using docker container running PostrgeSQL image. Created a database to keep and analyze the gathered information. Activated crontab to run a bash script every minute to collect the data and insert it into the database. Created SQL queries to detect possible host failures and average memory usage per host.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OlenaHlotova/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: A Java app designed to imitate Linux 'grep' command. It allows user to find matching strings in files (using regex).
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.

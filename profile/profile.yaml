summary: I am a forward-thinking Junior Software Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. I have proven myself focused and diligent in managing workloads and prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines. Working at Jarvis, I participated in multiple technical projects like Linux Monitoring Agent, Java Grepp and Twitter apps in the past few years. Creating useful apps people can use makes me extremely happy. For example, I wrote a Telegram bot that helps users keep track of their fitness exercises daily. I am ready to make a direct impact, utilizing abilities in quality control and complex problem-solving to find the best solutions and achieve desirable results.

    description: Designed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that can be used to record and monitor nodes/server hardware specifications and memory usage. Implemented the project on Linux CentOS 7 using a Docker container running PostgreSQL image. Created a database to keep and analyze the gathered information. Activated crontab to run a bash script every minute to collect the data and insert it into the database. Created SQL queries to detect possible host failures and average memory usage per host.
